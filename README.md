# Swapping My MacBook Pro for an iPad

I want to buy an iPad but can't justify the cost for the finite amount of use I want it for. I'm wondering if I can use it for more of what I use my MacBook for to make the cost worthwhile.

## Things I use my MacBook for...

...and whether I could use the iPad for this.

- [ ] ðŸ‘¾ Web Development
- [ ] ðŸŒµ Design (UI mostly)
- [ ] ðŸ“Š Planning stuff / data / graphs / etc
- [ ] ðŸŽ§ DJing (with Traktor)
- [ ] ðŸ“š Managing eBooks
- [ ] ðŸ’¬ IRC
- [ ] ðŸ’½ Managing server (mostly done through the browser to be fair)

### ðŸ‘¾ Web Development

After some research it looks like spinning up a local server on thr iPad is impossible. I saw this one coming but wanted to confirm it anyway. There are a few options out there, but one that has caught my eye is **Coder**.

Coder is an open source development environment serving VS Code. You host it yourself using something like Digital Ocean. I assume it's something you open up in your browser, but it'd be nice to know if there is an app in development, or that an existing app supports it.
