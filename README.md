# Swapping My MacBook Pro for an iPad

I want to buy an iPad but can't justify the cost for the finite amount of use I want it for. I'm wondering if I can use it for more of what I use my MacBook for to make the cost worthwhile.

## Things I use my MacBook for...

...and whether I could use the iPad for this.

### ðŸ‘¾ Web Development

After some research it looks like spinning up a local server on thr iPad is impossible. I saw this one coming but wanted to confirm it anyway. There are a few options out there, but one that has caught my eye is **Coder**.

Coder is an open source development environment serving VS Code. You host it yourself using something like Digital Ocean. I assume it's something you open up in your browser, but it'd be nice to know if there is an app in development, or that an existing app supports it.

(I also tried [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io), but it looks like you can only do public repos (or 'sandboxes') so that's kind of no good for me.)

### ðŸ““ Looking dev problems up

Realistically I probably spend over half my time developing looking things up. Other than the obvious Google/Stack Overflow, I wanted to make a note of an app called [Dash](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dash-offline-api-docs/id1239167694?mt=8) which is pretty much offline API docs â€” pretty handy.

### ðŸŒµ Design (UI mostly)

I don't think there's anything that's really a relevant replacement for Sketch for the iPad, and I can't imagine it would be an ideal solution even if there was. I mostly do this kind of thing for work, so I can just use my work laptop if I need to.


### ðŸŽ§ DJing (with Traktor)

There's a Traktor app for iOS which is plug and play with the KONTROL, so that should be covered. I guess the pain in the ass would be loading tracks onto the iPad, unless I went for the 1TB model but suddenly you're spending like Â£1,500+ so not really worth it.

### ðŸ“š Managing eBooks

I use an app called [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) to manage eBooks. I doubt there's anything similar available for the iPad (that'd be a pretty confusing setup anyhow) so I can probably use my work laptop for this as well.
